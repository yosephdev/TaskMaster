## How to Use

Task Management App is a command-line application, and its usage is straightforward:

1. View existing tasks.
2. Create new tasks.
3. Update or delete tasks as needed.
4. Prioritize tasks based on urgency or importance.

## Core Logic for Managing Tasks

The core logic for managing tasks is implemented within the Python script/module. This includes functions for adding tasks, updating task status, listing tasks, and deleting tasks. Basic data structures such as lists and dictionaries are used to store task information.
